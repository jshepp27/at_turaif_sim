AT TURAIF TOURISM SIMULATION
===
A 'True-to-Life' Agent-Based Spatial-Temporal Simulation to model Tourism in the Diriyah At-Turaif district. The simulation models activity, behaviours and preferences using: 

- Agent-Based-Models for behaviours and preferences for Visiting agents.
- Geographic Information System (GIS) to construct a environment from a 'real world' geography of At-Turaif, with corresponding tourist destinations and amenities.

CANON
===
- Agents are instantiated as Visitors. A singleton agent is a Visitor.
- Visitors are assigned a visitor_type at initialisation in accordance with the defined Visitor Types and thier respective probability distributions, given by relative wieghts.
- Visitors are assigned a length_of_stay in hours, at initialisation sampled from an hourly range, given by lengh_of_stay.
- Visitors are assigned a walk_speed which is defined categorically by thier Visitor Type and assigned a traversal speed in simulation.
- time_of_day: Lunch and Dinner times are defined as ranges over a given day. A Visitor will choose to attend Lunch or Dinner when they are not engaged in activities in these periods and thier length of stay has not exceed time in simulation.
- Visitors make decisions in accordance with the Visitor Decision Model, defined in AGENTS.
- A simulation runs over a period of 24 hours days given by simulation_days, where a total number of expected visitors to arrive over the simulation_days will be the total_expected_number_of_visitors.
- Each time-step given by time_step inisitalised at 15-minutes.
- The simulation models visitor arrivals between the operational_window=(0900, 2100) over any given day, using a Poisson distribution with rate λ. Where λ is the total expected number of visitors divided by the number of minutes in the operational window over the 5-day period.
- The number of visitors that arrive within the operational_window for any given day, varies by the daily_arrival_variation.
- Visitors have an attribute stay_over which is initially False. If a visitor has not exceeded their length_of_stay by 2300 on any given day, stay_over is set to True, indicating they will return the following day.

PARAMETERS
===
A simulation is initialised with various parameters that define a unique Tourist Planning Scenario. These parameters may be supplied as a .csv, where others are defined at variables within the simulation. 

- time_step: initialised at 15 minutes of real-time.
- operational_window: initialised (0900, 2100)
- simulation_days: number of simulation days initialised at 5.
- total_expected_number_of_visitors: the total expected number of visitors over the 5-day simulation period, initialised at 500.
- average_daily_expected_visitors: Calculated as total_expected_number_of_visitors / simulation_days. This represents the average number of visitors expected each day without variation.
- daily_arrival_variation: a percentage fluctuation (±%) applied to the average daily expected number of visitors to introduce variability. Initiallised at 0.125.
- number_of_visitors_per_day: adjusted daily as the `average_daily_expected_visitors` ± `daily_arrival_variation`. This ensures that each day has a slightly different number of visitors, reflecting the natural fluctuation of tourist numbers.
- arrival_rate (λ): For the Poisson distribution is calculated daily as: λ = number_of_visitors_per_day / operational_window_minutes.
- Visitor Types: the set of possible Visitor Types {{Families with Children, Students, Young Professionals, Seniors}} with Colour codes for Visualisation and categorical Walk Speeds, supplied as a .csv.
- Visitor Type Distributions: the relative-wieghted distribution over the possible Visitor Types, supplied as a .csv.
- Visitor Type Preferences: the list of prefered destinations for each Visitor Type. 
- length_of_stay: sampled between a range over (8, 12) hours.
- walk_speed: the speed at which Visitors traverse the GIS 'ways' on the map.
- number_of_visitors: the number of Visitors for any given simulation day arriving in the operational window ()
- time_of_day: initialised as lunch=(1200, 1400), dinner=(1700,1900).
- visitation_time at a given destination is modelled using a normal distribution, with the mean=90 minutes and standard deviation=15 minutes. This reflects the tendency for most visitation times to cluster around an average with some variation.

AGENTS
===
Agents are assigned Visitor Types, which define the preferences that influence the selection of available destinations over the duration of a visit, in hours.

Visitors decide what activities they will undertake in the simulation. These activities are determined probabilistically in accordance with their Visitor Types and according preference models. 

At each time step, Visitors take actions in accordance with the following decision model, which determines a utility function for each possible destination type. The utility function models the travel duration against the preference.

- Visitors choose destinations as decision-making loop that terminates when their length_of_stay is exceeded i.e. time_in_simulation > length_of_stay.
- Visitors choose a destination probabilistically in accordance with thier weighted preference utility model, sampled as a Monte-Carlo process and  the distance to the preferred destination, basis thier current location on the GIS map. 
- Visitors choose a destination based on a utility score calculated as: Utility = PreferenceWeight - (Distance/WalkSpeed). The destination with the highest utility is selected.
- Each destination's utility for a visitor is calculated with the formula: Utility = PreferenceWeight - (Distance/WalkSpeed).
- A Monte Carlo sampling approach is used to select a destination from the weighted list of utilities. Despite preferences, there is a non-zero probability for a visitor to choose any available destination, allowing for spontaneous decisions.
- The weighted random choice is implemented by constructing a cumulative distribution function (CDF) from the utilities, and then selecting a destination by generating a random number between 0 and 1 and finding where it falls on the CDF.
- Visitors attend a destination for a visitation_time which is randomly sampled from a defined range.
- Visitors attend Lunch or Dinner by selecting desintations of type amienities: restaurant or cafe in accordance with thier preference model.
- Utility scores are recalculated at each decision-making step, ensuring dynamic responses to the visitor's current location and remaining time.

The decision making loop is defined graphically by the following decision model:

VISUALISATION
===
The simulation is visualised as Vistors moving around a 'true-to-life' GIS map.

The GIS map depicts vector shape outlines for destinations {tourism, leisure, amenity}, 'ways' and 'buildings'. Where:
- Desinations are circular nodes.
- Ways are connected paths (lines).
- Buildings are enclosed shapes.

The GIS map has an OpenStreetMap 'like' map underlay for:
./environment.geojson

Vistors must be depicted as people icons that move around the GIS map with a colour coding that depicts thier Visitor Type. Where:
- Visitors walk around the GIS map, traversing GIS 'ways' to get to thier target destinations.
- Once they arrive at a target destination, they move inside the boundary of the enscoled GIS Buidling.
- For the duration that they are attending the destination, the visitor must take a random walk within the area enclosed by the GIS Building for the given destiation.
- Once a Visitor is finished attending a destination, the Visitor must exit the enclosed building and move to thier next location. 
- When the Visitors length_of_stay is elapsed, the vistor icon must dissapear from the map.

ENVIRONMENT
===
The environment is constructed from the following core GIS elements:

- Ways: defines a connected graph that Agents can traverse to arrive a destinations.
- Buildings: defines the buildings in the local geography that may or may not contain destinations.
- Destinations: are GIS objects of type: amenity or tourism, with a variety of different fields, such as: park, restaurant, cafe, museum etc.

Other GIS elements may esits and are defined in at_turaif.geojson.

For simplicity, Agents only interact with Ways, Buildings and Destinations. As an example, the list of GIS Destinations is given as follows:

./models/environment.geojson
./models/interactions.csv

VISITOR TYPES PREFERENCES
===
We assume pre-defined preferences for each unique Visitor Type.

Preference Table:
{preference_table}

In this way, preferred destinations map to individual Visitor Types, indicating the most likely destinations to be selected by any given Visitor of a given Visitor Type.
